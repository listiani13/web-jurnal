                <h2>Introduction</h2>
            </header>
            <p style="text-align:justify">This research is a collaborative project between Universitas Multimedia Nusantara (Indonesia) and Liverpool John Moores University (United Kingdom) in the area of medical image analysis and processing. Usually, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of the patient’s lumbar spine is used to check if any of the four possible causes of lower back pain discussed earlier occurred. However, this process may be time-consuming due to a large amount of data that the physicians must observe and take into account. This project aims at developing a methodology for automatic detection of disc herniation in Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) of lumbar spine using Artificial Intelligence techniques. Urgencies of this study is: Herniation of spinal disc is one of the main causes of Chronic Lower Back Pain (CLBP) and currently there is no existing solution to assist physicians in their task of identifying the cause of CLBP. They have to manually go through a series of MRIs and view them from different views. The process is a laborious task and can take up much of their time. This project will utilise existing Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques to scan the images and in the first year present the physicians with the location of areas of interest which they can review hence improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the overall diagnosis process by the area of the spinal disc has been labelled, its shape features can be calculated. In the second year perhaps the proposed methodology will be using the properties of the MRIs to detect spinal disc areas and detect any presence of herniation from the shape of the discs.  Research outputs include research reports each year, scientific publications (International Journal Scopus Indexed each year and International Conference each year), and the presence of methods and algorithms in the second year. The results of this study are closely related to the achievement of the UMN research plan because it is the focus of the UMN research field: ICT Based and the research output can increase UMN’s publications </p>

            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <ol style="text-align:justify">
                The objectives of this research are as follows:
                <li>To produce a complete literature review that catalogues previous achievements in the related area of research including image processing, computer vision, artificial intelligence, computer graphics, and physics simulation that would provide valuable knowledge, validation criteria and information of previous work relating to this research field.</li>
                <li>To develop a novel methodology that utilizes state-of-the-art computing technologies, that can be used as a Computer Aided Diagnosis tool, to help physicians in their effort to diagnose and manage CLBP cases. The methodology would consist of two parts which are Lumbar disc herniation detection using Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence techniques. The final outcome would be a system that takes MRI of CLBP patient’s lumbar spines as inputs and produces highlights of the lumbar disc if herniation is detected. The development of this part would include 1) the development of novel image features suitable for differentiating herniated and normal discs from their image appearances and 2) finding a suitable and best state-of-the-art AI technique for classifying the features by analyzing and comparing their performances.</li>
                <li>To implement a working prototype of the proposed methodology and evaluate its performance. The evaluation will be done a) quantitatively, by comparing its results with the most similar approaches in the literature and b) qualitatively, by getting feedback from physicians who use the proposed system.</li>
