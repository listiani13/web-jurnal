            <p>In the second year perhaps the proposed methodology will be using the properties of the MRIs to detect spinal disc areas and detect any presence of herniation from the shape of the discs. This research will derive and develop novel image features that are suited to differentiating herniated and normal discs from their image appearance. The project will be proposed for two years, to investigate spinal disc herniation detection using Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence techniques.  </p>
